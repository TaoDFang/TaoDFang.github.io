# Proteomics 

As I'm alway curious what is Mass Spectrometry for proteomics study. So today finally I spend sometime to learn it .
The paper I mainily read is "Introduction to Compuational Proteomics" from Jacques Colinge and Keiryn L. Bennett and [website of Thermo Fisher Scientific](https://www.thermofisher.com/ch/en/home/life-science/protein-biology/protein-biology-learning-center/protein-biology-resource-library/pierce-protein-methods/overview-mass-spectrometry.html#:~:text=Overview%20of%20Mass%20Spectrometry%20for%20Protein%20Analysis&text=Mass%20spectrometry%20(MS)%20analysis%20of,fields%20and%20applications%2C%20including%20proteomics).
  
Now I'm still not know the details of MS but a genenral impression.
From my understanding. In a typical proteomics study:

  1. It first involves preotein sepration, enzymatic digestion of separated 
      proteins and further separation of produced peptide. 
  2. Then a ion source will be used to ionized peptides. Previous to  this step, peptide is ususaly vaporized.
  3. Then the ions/peptides will pass mass analyzer in which either electic or magnetic fields are applied. So the time of ions passing         the analyzer and maybe be other metrics are mainly decided by the mass-to-charge ratio(m/z) of these peptides and detected by ion         detector at the end of whole pipeline 
  4. In the end, after ions and their m/z ratios were collected, these ions/peptides will be serached against some popular protein database  for further protein identification,chracterization, quantification and so on. Usually not protein sequences in proteins database are used directy but first be digested into a set of peptides in silico .

# workshop of self-confidence 
As a PhD Student in LSZGS progra, I have to get some credits from some soft skills course. The first one I Decided to choose is 
"Self-Confidence" since I recognized myself as the one have low confidence. 
The preparation for thi course is to write down  up and downs of events in personal and professional life and then summaried them with 
two sentences. One for personal and one for profressional. 
Here is my summary of previous life before wrokshop starts  tomorrow. 

Private: I used to be very happy but wasting time until my self-esteem get hurted.
Professsional: I think I fulfilled my basic dupies at most of time and sometimes I can explore new things bravely. But I haven't done anything I could be very pround of.

It's shamful and not easy to admit that I have never doen anything that is  meaningful. The main reasons that I'm never really serious to do something concrete and useful I think are  overconcerns of other's and family's jugements and worries about potential failures since all the useful things I want to do really takes time and possibly could no do me any good in term of career develpment. So I feel more confortable to do somthing that is predictable and no big mistakes making. Also I'm easily distracted and could not use my time efficiently. If I'm really gifted. I could use limited time to finish my daily stuff and then try new things. But sinnce I'm not one of these genius. I really need to be self-displined and have a good time maangement. 

While I usally forget that good things usually meaning no one does it before and it is really essential for some people. If I always follower other people and do not 

why this realted to selfp-confidence? dont care others people but myself. so i can respect myself. finish this later
