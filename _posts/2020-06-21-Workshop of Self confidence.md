# workshop of self-confidence
As a PhD Student in LSZGS progra, I have to get some credits from some soft skills course. The first one I Decided to choose is
"Self-Confidence" since I recognized myself as the one have low confidence.
The preparation for thi course is to write down  up and downs of events in personal and professional life and then summaried them with
two sentences. One for personal and one for profressional.
Here is my summary of previous life before wrokshop starts  tomorrow.

Private: I used to be very happy but wasting time until my self-esteem get hurted.
Professsional: I think I fulfilled my basic dupies at most of time and sometimes I can explore new things bravely. But I haven't done anything I could be very pround of.

The main reasons that I'm never really serious to do something concrete and useful I think are  overconcerns of other's and family's jugements and worries about potential failures since all the useful things I want to do really takes time and possibly could no do me any good in term of career develpment. So I feel more confortable to do somthing that is predictable and no big mistakes making. Also I'm easily distracted and could not use my time efficiently. If I'm really gifted. I could use limited time to finish my daily stuff and then try new things. But sinnce I'm not one of these genius. I really need to be self-displined and have a good time maangement.

While I usally forget that good things usually meaning no one does it before and it is really essential for some people. If I always follower other people and do not

why this realted to selfp-confidence? dont care others people but myself. so i can respect myself. finish this later with notes of workshop.
