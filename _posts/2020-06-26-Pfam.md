As I frequently use HMMER in my currently PhD project, while Pfam is a very popular database in which HMMER is aslo intensively applied.
Its also quite interesting to know some key contributors/authors of HMMER package are also play essentional roles in Pfam.
So recently I read several paper of Pfam to get a feeling of whats the "right way" to use HMMER :)
Before futher jumping to my understaing of Ffam. I want also to share some personly feeling after reading Pfam papers.
I knew already Pfam is first created longtime ago. While after actural going back to first Pfam paper publised in 1997.
I do realized development of  Pfam is a continously updataing process to fit to new data and knowledge of bioinformatics like any other great database. And many great sciencetis and software enginners  do spend many of there profession life time in maintain and improve Pfam database. They are amazing  !

# first paper at 1997
Pfam database was first developed to creat a comprehensive protein family database with both good quaity of multiple sequence algnment and also semi-automatic updating  to deal with the reality  that size of protein sequecen database grows exponentially.

Ignore how to choose member of each protein family for a moment. Presumably  I will update this later :)
Good quality of contruction of  good alignment of each protein family usually need manually curation.  While considering MSA of these protein famimily will also need to be continuoly updated as new proteins sequences are generated everday. If we do full MSA every time mamually, the computation time and larbor cost would be insanely high.
So Pfam propose to build protein family profile (profile HMM ) on "seed alignment" which consiste of only representive preotein sequence of each protein family. Then these profile HMM will be used to seach in any whole pretei sequence database to obtain all proteins in every protein family.
Seed alignments are intentinly keeped stable and will only  be changed if new pretein sequence could not be mapped to any of existing profile HMM. So most of new sequenced protein will only be added to full alignment of protein family and will not affect profile HMM based on seed algnment 
Seed alignments are collected either from other database or build from scratch (mostly by ClustalW)
